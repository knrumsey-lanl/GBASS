\arguments{
\item{X}{an Nxp matrix of predictor variables.}

\item{y}{an Nx1 matrix (or vector) of response values.}

\item{w_prior}{a named list specifying the prior for the global variance component. See details.}

\item{maxInt}{integer for maximum degree of interaction in spline basis functions. Defaults to the number of predictors, which could result in overfitting.}

\item{maxBasis}{maximum number of basis functions. This should probably only be altered if you run out of memory.}

\item{npart}{of non-zero points in a basis function. If the response is functional, this refers only to the portion of the basis function coming from the non-functional predictors. Defaults to 20 or 0.1 times the number of observations, whichever is smaller.}

\item{nmcmc}{number of mcmc iterations}

\item{nburn}{number of burn-in samples}

\item{thin}{thinning for mcmc}

\item{moveProbs}{a vector defining the probabilities for (i) birth (ii) death and (iii) mutation. Default is rep(1/3,3).}

\item{a_tau}{prior for tau}

\item{b_tau}{prior for tyau}

\item{a_lambda}{prior for lambda}

\item{b_lambda}{prior for lambda}

\item{m_beta}{prior for beta}

\item{s_beta}{prior for beta}

\item{lag_beta}{number of steps for which beta is fixed to m_beta (usually zero)}

\item{m_gamma}{prior for gamma}

\item{s_gamma}{prior for gamma}

\item{scale}{fixed variance parameter. default is one.}

\item{Iw0}{vector of nominal weights for degree of interaction, used in generating candidate basis functions. Should have length equal to Jmax and have positive entries.}

\item{Zw0}{vector of nominal weights for variable selection, used in generating candidate basis functions. Should have length equal to ncol(X) and have positive entries.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Should gbass print completion status? Default TRUE}

\item{v_prior}{a named list specifying the (shared) prior for the local variance components. See details.}
}
\value{
The returned value is a named list with components for each of the MCMC parameters. The acceptance rates for each move type is returned. If applicable, we also return acceptance rates for w and the v_i.
}
\description{
An experimental function nwbass with error terms fixed to mean zero.
}
\details{
Currently, the prior for w and v_i must belong to the class of Generalized inverse Gaussian (GIG) or Generalized Beta Prime (GBP) priors. The list should have the following named fields
\enumerate{
\item type. either "GIG" or "GBP".
\item p, a, b. Hyperparameters for the prior. p,a,b > 0 for GBP. See ?rgig2 for details on GIG parameters.
\item prop_sigma. The proposal standard deviation for Metropolis-Hastings. Only needed if type="GBP" or if type="GIG" and beta is not fixed at zero.
\item lb. An optional lower bound which truncates the prior for w. This argument is ignored when specified for v_prior.
}
The build_prior function can be used to construct these priors.
}
\note{
Some comments about current deficiencies in the code.
\enumerate{
\item basis function parameters are stored as lists.
\item burn-in and thinning is not implemented intelligently.
\item continuous uniform prior for knot locations.
\item assumes a ridge prior for basis coefficients.
